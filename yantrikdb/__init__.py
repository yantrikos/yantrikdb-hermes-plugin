"""YantrikDB memory plugin — self-maintaining memory for Hermes.

YantrikDB is a memory provider that actively maintains what it stores
instead of behaving like an append-only vector index:

- ``think()`` runs a bounded maintenance pass — canonicalizes duplicates,
  flags superseded or contradictory facts, and mines co-occurrence
  patterns.
- Contradiction tracking surfaces conflicting claims for the agent to
  resolve explicitly (``resolve_conflict``) rather than overwriting
  silently.
- Recency-aware ranking prefers fresher facts over stale ones without
  deleting the older records — every result is annotated with a
  ``why_retrieved`` reason list so recall is explainable.
- A knowledge graph promotes related memories in recall through entity
  edges created via ``relate``.

The plugin is a thin HTTP client against an externally managed
``yantrikdb-server`` (see README for deployment). The plugin never
starts, stops, or upgrades the backend — same pattern as ``honcho``.

Config via env + $HERMES_HOME/yantrikdb.json:
  YANTRIKDB_URL              — default http://localhost:7438
  YANTRIKDB_TOKEN            — required, Bearer token from `yantrikdb token create`
  YANTRIKDB_NAMESPACE        — default "hermes"; combined with agent_workspace:agent_identity
  YANTRIKDB_TOP_K            — default 10
  YANTRIKDB_READ_TIMEOUT     — default 15.0 seconds
  YANTRIKDB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT  — default 5.0 seconds
  YANTRIKDB_RETRY_TOTAL      — default 3 retries on transient 5xx
  YANTRIKDB_MAX_TEXT_LEN     — default 25000 chars; text is truncated client-side above this

# Skills are procedural memory: reusable patterns the agent distills
# from observed success and pulls back next session. They live in the
# shared ``skill_substrate`` namespace alongside skills authored by
# other YantrikDB consumers — Hermes-authored entries are tagged
# ``metadata.source=hermes`` so any consumer can filter Hermes-authored
# skills in or out cleanly. Outcomes are append-only; success/failure
# rollup is the agent's pedagogy decision, not the substrate's.
#
# Note: this is a peer surface to the filesystem skills Hermes already
# has at $HERMES_HOME/skills/. Filesystem = human-authored, durable,
# version-controlled. YantrikDB skills = agent-authored, runtime-
# evolving, semantic-search-queryable. Different kinds of canonical;
